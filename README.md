# 📌 Improving Dock Efficiency and Predicting Delivery Delays in Logistics
### 🚛 Project: Trucking-Efficiency-Prediction

## 🧠 Project Overview: This project analyzes shipment trip data to improve dock scheduling and reduce delivery delays. By using route, time, and location data, we predict which shipments are likely to be delayed and identify inefficient docks and time windows. The goal is to help logistics operations become more efficient through data insights.
## 🔍 Problem Statement: In trucking and logistics, poor dock scheduling and route planning can lead to delays, increased costs, and lower customer satisfaction. This project addresses two challenges: 
1. Predicting whether a delivery will be delayed based on pre-trip data.
2. Identifying bottlenecks at specific docks (origin and destination) to improve scheduling efficiency.
